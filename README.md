The "Dollar Smile": A Quantitative Analysis of USD Regimes and Their Impact on Cross-Asset Performance
Project Description

This project provides a quantitative framework to validate the "Dollar Smile" theory through data-driven analysis of USD market regimes and their impact on cross-asset performance. The Dollar Smile theory suggests that the U.S. Dollar strengthens during two distinct scenarios: strong U.S. economic growth and significant global risk aversion.

Using publicly available financial data from 2020-2024, this study successfully developed a rule-based model to classify trading days into distinct market regimes and analyzed the performance of key asset classes within each environment. The results provide strong empirical validation of the Dollar Smile theory with statistically significant findings.

Research Questions and Answers
Key Questions Addressed:

Can we quantitatively define and historically identify distinct market regimes based on the strength and volatility of the USD?
Answer: YES, Successfully identified four distinct regimes using VIX percentiles and DXY 50-day ROC:

Risk-Off Dollar Strength: 168 days (16.7%) - concentrated during COVID crash and 2022 stress
Pro-Growth Dollar Strength: 128 days (12.7%) - clustered during 2021 bull market
Dollar Weakness: 394 days (39.2%) - dominated 2022-2023 period
Neutral/Sideways: 266 days (26.4%) - baseline market conditions

How do different asset classes perform within these distinct regimes?
Answer: Dramatic performance differences
Risk-Off Dollar Strength:

SPY: -22.1% annualized, -0.61 Sharpe ratio
EEM: -48.9% annualized, -1.32 Sharpe ratio (severely underperformed)
GLD: -8.0% annualized, -0.41 Sharpe ratio

Pro-Growth Dollar Strength:

SPY: +66.7% annualized, 7.43 Sharpe ratio (exceptional performance)
EEM: +34.8% annualized, 2.51 Sharpe ratio
GLD: +7.5% annualized, 0.65 Sharpe ratio

Dollar Weakness:

SPY: +28.1% annualized, 1.69 Sharpe ratio
EEM: +35.1% annualized, 1.87 Sharpe ratio (outperformed SPY)
GLD: +17.6% annualized, 1.13 Sharpe ratio


Do these regime relationships remain stable across different market cycles?
Answer: YES, statistical significance confirms regime persistence:

EEM performance differences: p-value = 0.047 (statistically significant)
All three Dollar Smile predictions empirically validated
Regime classification aligned with known historical events

Market Regime Classification:
The analysis uses a rule-based model to classify each trading day into four regimes:

Regime 1: Risk-Off Dollar Strength - VIX > 75th percentile (26.3) AND DXY 50-day ROC > 0
Regime 2: Pro-Growth Dollar Strength - VIX < 25th percentile (17.3) AND DXY 50-day ROC > 0
Regime 3: Dollar Weakness - DXY 50-day ROC < 0
Regime 4: Neutral/Sideways - All other periods

Regime thresholds calculated dynamically from the dataset:

VIX 25th percentile: 17.3 (low volatility threshold)
VIX 75th percentile: 26.3 (high volatility threshold)

Results and Applications
Key Findings:
Dollar Smile Theory VALIDATED, all three core predictions confirmed:

Risk-Off Dollar Strength: Emerging markets severely underperformed (-48.9% vs -22.1% for SPY)
Pro-Growth Dollar Strength: U.S. assets excelled with exceptional risk-adjusted returns (7.43 Sharpe ratio)
Dollar Weakness: Emerging markets outperformed U.S. assets (+35.1% vs +28.1%)

Statistical Robustness:

EEM performance differences across regimes: p-value = 0.047 (statistically significant)
Regime classification successfully captured major market events (COVID crash, 2021 recovery, 2022 dollar strength)

Practical Applications:
Tactical Asset Allocation:

Risk-Off periods: Reduce emerging market exposure, maintain U.S. equity allocation
Pro-Growth periods: Overweight U.S. equities for superior risk-adjusted returns
Dollar Weakness: Tilt toward emerging markets and commodities

Risk Management:

Monitor VIX and DXY 50-day ROC as early warning indicators
Implement regime-specific hedging strategies
Adjust position sizing based on regime-specific volatility patterns

Portfolio Construction:

Regime-aware rebalancing frequencies
Enhanced diversification strategies
Performance attribution by regime exposure
